üß† Pro-Quant Upgrade Guidance (for AI Assistant)
üéØ Goal

Strengthen our feature-based, supervised alpha modeling pipeline with professional-grade practices for:

US Equities (incl. sector rotation & macro)

Top-Liquid Crypto (BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, etc.)

Live-ready operations (cron, alerts, guardrails)

‚úÖ What to KEEP

Feature-based alpha: technical + PIT fundamentals

Cross-sectional ranking / regression models

Weekly rebalance (equities); separate crypto sleeve

11-stage modular pipeline and backtester

üîß What to MODIFY (High impact, low friction)
1) Sleeve-specific cadence & horizons

Equities: rebalance weekly; horizons = [5, 10, 20] days (pick via walk-forward IC/Sharpe)

Crypto: rebalance 2‚Äì3√ó/week; horizons = [3, 7] days

2) Use Ranking objective for equities

Prefer LightGBM/CB Ranker; primary metric: Rank IC

Keep regression variant for diagnostics

3) Walk-forward CV with purge + embargo

Rolling OOS selection of horizons & hyperparams

Prevent label overlap leakage

4) Turnover control

Turnover cap (e.g., ‚â§ 80% annualized)

Min trade threshold; optional L1/L2 penalty on weight changes

5) Volatility targeting per sleeve

Equities target vol ~ 10%

Crypto target vol ~ 30‚Äì40%

Scale portfolio weights to target realized vol

‚ûï What to ADD
A) Sector rotation track (equities)

Build sector ETF panel (XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLY, XLP, XLI, XLB, XLRE, XLU, XLC)

Add macro features: yield curve slope, PMI, CPI YoY, unemployment, credit spreads, DXY

Two-stage allocation: overweight sectors ‚Üí stock-pick within those sectors

B) Cross-sleeve allocation optimizer

Allocate across Equities / Crypto / Cash

Start with ERC (equal risk contribution) or risk parity

Advanced: regularized MVO with risk budgets (e.g., crypto risk ‚â§ 25%)

C) Risk overlays & guardrails

Exposure limits: per-name ‚â§ 5%, per-sector ‚â§ 25%, net beta bounds

Liquidity limits: equities as %ADV; crypto as % of 30m volume

Kill switches: halt signals if daily loss > X%, or live Sharpe below threshold over N weeks

D) Model governance & diagnostics

MLflow model registry, tags

SHAP / feature importance each retrain; prune dead features quarterly

Report deflated Sharpe / bootstrap CIs

E) Monitoring & Ops

Cron schedules: equities after close, crypto daily or 3√ó/week

Email/Slack report: positions delta, turnover, sleeve vol, PnL, breaches

Runbook for outages, model failure, kill-switch

üóÇÔ∏è Module Add-ons (extend 11-step flow)

regime_detection.py

Detect risk-on/off via vol, drawdown, macro (HMM or rules)

Output: risk multiplier, sector tilts

sleeve_allocation.py

Inputs: sleeve Œº, vol, corr

Methods: ERC / regularized MVO + risk budgets

Output: sleeve weights

turnover_manager.py

Enforce turnover cap, min trade size, rounding, cost-aware deltas

monitoring.py

Generate daily/weekly ops report & alerts; log KPIs and breaches

üß™ Validation & Testing Checklist
Data & Features

 PIT alignment for fundamentals (public_date)

 No forward-looking features; labels use .shift(-N)

 Train/val/test split is chronological

Modeling

 Walk-forward CV with purge & embargo

 Rank IC (primary), IC, MSE (secondary)

 SHAP/feature importance stored per run

Portfolio & Risk

 Vol targeting; turnover cap enforced

 Exposure, liquidity, sector caps validated

 Kill-switch logic unit-tested

Ops

 Cron jobs & retries set; logs persisted

 Email/Slack report includes positions delta, PnL, breaches

 Runbook exists for data/model failures

üß© Implementation Tasks (AI Assistant)

Ranking model (equities): Implement LightGBM Ranker path; add Rank IC metric.

Walk-forward CV: Add purged K-fold with embargo; grid horizons by sleeve.

Turnover manager: Pre-trade smoothing + cap + min trade threshold.

Vol targeting: Scale weights to hit target sleeve volatility.

Sector rotation: Build sector ETF dataset + macro features; two-stage allocation.

Sleeve allocator: ERC baseline; optional regularized MVO with risk budgets.

Risk overlays: Exposure, liquidity caps; kill-switch module.

Monitoring: Cron configs, email template, run summaries & breach alerts.

Governance: MLflow model registry; SHAP plots; deflated Sharpe report.

Scenario analysis: Equity crash / crypto crash / both; save stress-test results.

üì§ Email/Slack Report (Template)

Subject: Daily Strategy Report ‚Äî {date}
Body:

PnL (day / MTD / YTD) by sleeve

Target vs. realized vol, turnover (vs. cap)

Position changes (top adds/cuts), exposure & sector caps

Breaches/Kill-switch status

Next scheduled run & data health

üß≠ TL;DR

Keep the core pipeline.

Add ranking, walk-forward with embargo, vol targeting, turnover control.

Introduce sector rotation + sleeve allocation + risk guardrails.

Operationalize with cron + alerts + monitoring.

This elevates us from a solid research system to a professional, live-ready quant workflow.
