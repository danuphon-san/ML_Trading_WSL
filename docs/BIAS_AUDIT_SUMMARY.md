# Bias Audit Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

---

## 🚨 Critical Finding: Data Leakage Discovered and Fixed!

### The Problem

Your model showed **IC = 0.9932** (99.32% correlation with future returns) - this was too good to be true!

**Root Cause**: A feature called `risk_adjusted_return_5d` was being used for training. This feature contained the **forward return** (the label) divided by volatility - essentially giving the model the answer!

### The Fix

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/ml/dataset.py:88` - Excluded `risk_adjusted_return` from features
2. `src/labeling/labels.py:95-116` - Added warning comments
3. `tests/test_no_leakage.py` - Created automated tests

**Impact**:
- ✅ Data leakage eliminated
- ✅ Automated tests prevent future leakage
- ⚠️ Expected IC will drop to realistic levels (0.01-0.15)
- ⚠️ Backtest returns will be lower but MUCH more trustworthy

### ✅ Fixed Issues

| Bias Type | Severity | Status | Fix |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----|
| **Look-Ahead Bias** | 🚨 CRITICAL | ✅ FIXED | Excluded leaked features |
| **Survivorship Bias** | ⚠️ HIGH | ⚠️ DOCUMENTED | Added warnings |
| **Execution Timing** | ⚠️ MODERATE | ✅ IMPROVED | Added timing parameter |

### ✅ Already Well-Handled

| Bias Type | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Temporal Ordering** | ✅ GOOD | Time-based splits with 5-day embargo |
| **PIT Alignment** | ✅ EXCELLENT | Infrastructure ready for fundamentals |
| **Trading Costs** | ✅ GOOD | 1bp commission + 2bp slippage |
| **Feature Engineering** | ✅ GOOD | Uses only lagged features |

### ⚠️ Acknowledged Limitations

| Issue | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Survivorship Bias** | 1-3% annual inflation | Documented, warnings added |
| **Test Period** | Bull market bias | Test on multiple regimes |
| **Sampling Period** | Limited to 2015-2025 | Acceptable for now |

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. ✅ `tests/test_no_leakage.py` - Automated leakage detection
2. ✅ `docs/BIAS_MITIGATION.md` - Complete bias documentation
3. ✅ `docs/BIAS_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified Files
1. ✅ `src/ml/dataset.py` - Fixed feature selection + added 3-way split function
2. ✅ `src/labeling/labels.py` - Added warnings
3. ✅ `src/io/universe.py` - Documented survivorship bias

## 🧪 Verification

### Run Tests
```bash
# Test for data leakage
pytest tests/test_no_leakage.py -v
```

**Expected Result**: All tests should pass ✅

### Re-train Model
Your model MUST be retrained to see the benefits of these fixes:

```python
# In your notebook, simply re-run the training cells
# The fixed feature selection will automatically exclude leaked features
```

## 📉 Expected Performance Changes

### Before Fixes (Unrealistic)
- IC: 0.9932 ← **TOO HIGH** (data leakage!)
- R²: 0.9861
- Sharpe: 16.46
- Annual Return: 257%

### After Fixes (Realistic)
- IC: 0.01 - 0.15 ← Realistic range
- R²: 0.01 - 0.10
- Sharpe: 0.5 - 2.0
- Annual Return: -10% to +30%

**Note**: The performance will drop significantly, but the results will be **trustworthy** and reflect what you'd actually achieve in live trading.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Do Now)
1. ✅ **Re-train your model** - Run the notebook again
2. ✅ **Run tests** - Verify no leakage: `pytest tests/test_no_leakage.py`
3. ✅ **Check new IC** - Should be 0.01-0.15 (if higher, investigate!)

### Short-term (This Week)
1. ⏳ Review backtest results with realistic performance
2. ⏳ Consider using 3-way split: `create_three_way_split()` now available
3. ⏳ Add `execution_timing: 'next_open'` to config for conservative backtests

### Long-term (Before Production)
1. ⏳ Paper trade for 3-6 months
2. ⏳ Test on different market regimes (2008, 2020 crash)
3. ⏳ Address survivorship bias (use historical constituents or broader universe)
4. ⏳ Implement regular model retraining schedule

## ✨ Key Takeaways

1. **Critical data leakage was found and fixed** - Your original results were invalid
2. **Automated tests** now prevent future leakage
3. **Survivorship bias acknowledged** - Results may still be optimistic by 1-3% annually
4. **Good practices already in place** - Time-based splits, PIT infrastructure, trading costs
5. **Model must be retrained** - Old results are not trustworthy
