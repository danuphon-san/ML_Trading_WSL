# Bias Mitigation Guide

This document describes all biases identified in the ML trading system and the mitigation strategies implemented.

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ✅ Critical biases identified and mitigated
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (down from CRITICAL after fixes)

---

## 1. Look-Ahead Bias 🚨 **FIXED**

### Problem Identified
**Feature**: `risk_adjusted_return_5d` contained future information (forward returns)
**Impact**: Model IC = 0.9932 (unrealistic) - essentially giving the model the answer
**Severity**: **CRITICAL** - Completely invalidated backtest results

### Root Cause
In `src/labeling/labels.py:106`:
```python
df[f'risk_adjusted_return_{self.horizon}d'] = df[f'forward_return_{self.horizon}d'] / volatility
```

This created a feature from the LABEL (future return), causing massive data leakage.

### Fix Implemented
**File**: `src/ml/dataset.py:88`
```python
# Skip label columns (any column with 'forward' or 'risk_adjusted_return')
# CRITICAL: risk_adjusted_return contains future information (labels)!
if col.startswith('forward_') or 'risk_adjusted_return' in col:
    continue
```

**Verification**: `tests/test_no_leakage.py` - automated tests to detect future data in features

### Expected Impact
- Model IC should drop to realistic levels (0.01-0.15)
- Backtest returns will be lower (more realistic)
- Sharpe ratio will decrease

---

## 2. Survivorship Bias ⚠️ **DOCUMENTED**

### Problem Identified
**Function**: `src/io/universe.py:load_sp500_constituents()`
**Issue**: Loads only CURRENT S&P 500 members, excluding:
- Delisted companies
- Bankrupt companies
- Companies removed from index

**Impact**: Backtest performance inflated by 1-3% annually

### Current Status
**ACKNOWLEDGED** - Cannot fully fix without historical constituent data

### Mitigation Strategies
1. ✅ Added prominent warning in code documentation
2. ✅ Logger warning on each load
3. 📋 Recommended: Apply 1-2% annual "reality discount" to backtest returns
4. 📋 Future: Use historical constituent data or broader universe

### Recommendations
- **Short-term**: Document this limitation clearly in all results
- **Long-term**: Switch to historical S&P 500 constituent data or Russell 3000

---

## 3. Data Snooping Bias ✅ **WELL-HANDLED**

### Current Implementation
**File**: `src/ml/dataset.py:114-148`
- ✅ Time-based train/test split (not random)
- ✅ 5-day embargo period between train and test
- ✅ Walk-forward validation available (`create_cv_folds`)

### Remaining Improvements
- ⏳ Add final holdout test set (three-way split)
- ⏳ Limit number of hyperparameter tuning cycles

---

## 4. Temporal Leakage ✅ **INFRASTRUCTURE READY**

### Current Status
**File**: `src/features/fa_features.py`
- ✅ Excellent PIT (Point-in-Time) alignment infrastructure
- ✅ `pit_min_lag_days` parameter
- ✅ `earnings_blackout_days` parameter
- ✅ `default_public_lag_days` fallback

### Limitation
⚠️ Fundamental features **NOT YET USED** in current pipeline
Only technical features are being used (which are inherently PIT-aligned)

### Recommendation
When adding fundamental features, the PIT infrastructure is ready to use.

---

## 5. Overfitting Bias 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**

### Identified Issues
1. **Suspiciously high metrics** (before fix):
   - IC = 0.9932 (caused by data leakage - NOW FIXED)
   - R² = 0.9861 (will improve after fix)

2. **Model configuration**:
   - ✅ Using XGBoost with early stopping
   - ✅ Time-series cross-validation available
   - ⚠️ May need more regularization after fixing leakage

### Mitigation
- ✅ Data leakage fixed (primary cause)
- ✅ Time-based validation
- 📋 Monitor IC after retraining (should be 0.01-0.15)
- 📋 Add more regularization if needed

---

## 6. Execution/Realism Bias ⚠️ **IMPROVED**

### Problem Identified
**File**: `src/backtest/bt_engine.py:69`
```python
prices = price_data[price_data['date'] == rebal_date].set_index('symbol')['close'].to_dict()
```

**Issue**: Ambiguous whether execution happens at:
- Same-day close (unrealistic if using same-day data)
- Next-day open (more realistic)

### Fix Implemented
**File**: `src/backtest/bt_engine.py:31-44`
- ✅ Added `execution_timing` parameter
- ✅ Warning logged when using 'close' execution
- ✅ Option for 'next_open' (more realistic)

### Costs Included
✅ **Well-handled**:
- Commission: 1 bps per trade
- Slippage: 2 bps per trade
- Configurable per asset class

### Recommendation
Set `execution_timing: 'next_open'` in config for conservative backtests.

---

## 7. Sampling Bias ⚠️ **MODERATE**

### Current Setup
- **Training period**: 2015-01-01 to 2023-08-23 (~8.5 years)
- **Test period**: 2023-08-29 to 2025-10-22 (~2 years)

### Analysis
✅ **Good aspects**:
- Covers multiple market regimes
- Includes COVID crash (2020)
- Reasonable length

⚠️ **Concerns**:
- Test period mostly bull market
- May not generalize to bear markets

### Recommendations
- Test on 2008 financial crisis period
- Test on different market regimes separately
- Use walk-forward validation across all periods

---

## 8. Anchoring/Human Bias ✅ **ACCEPTABLE**

### Current Approach
**Feature Selection**:
- ✅ Automated feature selection (`auto_select_features=True`)
- ⚠️ Manual choice of lookback windows [5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200]

### Mitigation
- Standard lookback windows are industry-accepted
- Could improve with automated window selection (future enhancement)

---

## 9. Reinforcement/Feedback Bias 📋 **NOT APPLICABLE YET**

### Status
Not yet in production, so no feedback loop concerns.

### Future Considerations (when live)
- Monitor model drift monthly
- Retrain regularly with updated data
- Track if model affects market conditions (unlikely at small scale)

---

## Testing & Verification

### Automated Tests
**File**: `tests/test_no_leakage.py`

Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_no_leakage.py -v
```

Tests include:
1. ✅ Labels use only future data
2. ✅ Features use only past data
3. ✅ Feature-label correlation check (catches data leakage)
4. ✅ Shift direction verification
5. ✅ Realistic IC threshold warnings

### Manual Checks
Before deploying any model:
- [ ] IC < 0.30 (realistic range)
- [ ] Sharpe ratio < 5 (unless very special circumstances)
- [ ] Weights sum to 1.0
- [ ] No NaN values in predictions
- [ ] PIT alignment verified for any fundamental features

## Expected Results After Fixes

### Before Fixes
- IC = 0.9932 (unrealistic!)
- R² = 0.9861
- Sharpe = 16.46
- Total Return = 28.75% (2 years)

### After Fixes (Expected)
- IC = 0.01 to 0.15 (realistic)
- R² = 0.01 to 0.10
- Sharpe = 0.5 to 2.0
- Total Return = Lower but more realistic

**NOTE**: Performance will decrease significantly, but results will be MUCH more trustworthy and closer to live trading reality.

---

## Recommendations for Production

### Before Going Live
1. ✅ Retrain model without leaked features
2. ⏳ Implement three-way data split
3. ⏳ Test on multiple market regimes
4. ⏳ Paper trade for 3-6 months
5. ⏳ Compare paper trading vs backtest (slippage check)

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Track IC monthly (should remain 0.01-0.15)
- Monitor model drift
- Retrain quarterly
- Update universe to avoid survivorship bias
