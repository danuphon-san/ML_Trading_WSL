# üìò Bias-Free Feature Engineering for Machine Learning in Stock Trading

This markdown file serves as a guide for designing machine learning features for stock trading models that minimize or eliminate common data biases.

---

## üéØ Objective

To build a reliable machine learning model for trading, you must design **features** that:

* Are based only on information **available at time *t***.
* Do **not leak future data** (avoid look-ahead bias).
* Represent the **true market environment**, not an idealized one.

## üß† 1. Common Biases to Avoid

| Bias Type              | Description                               | Prevention Strategy                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Look-ahead Bias**    | Using future information in training data | Only use data available at or before time *t* |
| **Survivorship Bias**  | Ignoring delisted or failed stocks        | Include delisted/inactive stocks if possible  |
| **Data Snooping Bias** | Over-tuning on test data                  | Keep a final untouched test set               |
| **Temporal Leakage**   | Using data that was published later       | Align all features by release timestamp       |
| **Overfitting Bias**   | Model learns noise                        | Use regularization, cross-validation          |
| **Execution Bias**     | Unrealistic trade assumptions             | Add slippage, transaction cost modeling       |
| **Sampling Bias**      | Training on limited market conditions     | Include multiple market regimes               |
| **Modeler Bias**       | Human preference in feature choice        | Automate feature generation and selection     |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Example: Safe Python Feature Pipeline

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df['log_ret'] = np.log(df['Close'] / df['Close'].shift(1))

# Rolling features (all use past data)
df['sma_10'] = df['Close'].rolling(10).mean()
df['sma_50'] = df['Close'].rolling(50).mean()
df['vol_10'] = df['log_ret'].rolling(10).std()
df['momentum_10'] = df['Close'] / df['Close'].shift(10) - 1
df['rsi_14'] = compute_rsi(df['Close'], 14)
df['atr_14'] = compute_atr(df['High'], df['Low'], df['Close'], 14)

# Normalized signal
df['price_zscore'] = (df['Close'] - df['sma_50']) / df['vol_10']

# Drop NaN values from rolling calculations
df = df.dropna()
```

‚úÖ **All features above are time-aligned and bias-free.**

## üö´ 4. Features to Avoid

| Feature                              | Reason                                     |                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Future Returns or Future Price       | Leaks future info (look-ahead bias)        |                  |
| Future-based Indicators              | e.g., using next-day SMA                   | Temporal leakage |
| Future Fundamentals                  | Data not yet released                      | Temporal leakage |
| Optimized Parameters (post-backtest) | Data snooping bias                         |                  |
| Current Index Membership Only        | Excludes failed stocks (survivorship bias) |                  |

## üß© 5. Recommended ML Targets

* **Binary Classification:** Predict next-period direction (up/down)
* **Regression:** Predict next return magnitude (`r_t+1`)
* **Ranking:** Predict relative strength among multiple assets

Make sure labels are **shifted forward** (so the model predicts future outcome) but features stop at time *t*.

## ‚úÖ 7. Key Takeaways

* Only use **historical or lagged features**.
* Always **time-align** fundamentals and macro data.
* Simulate **real-world execution conditions** in backtesting.
* Avoid optimizing on test data ‚Äî use **walk-forward validation**.

### üß∞ Bonus: Automation Tip

If your AI assistant supports coding automation, you can instruct it to:

1. Generate these features from OHLCV data.
2. Validate time alignment for each column.
3. Export the dataset as `bias_free_features.csv`.
4. Optionally, integrate with your trading simulation pipeline.
